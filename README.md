Cumulus is a high-level framework that makes developing application logic on top of Firebase quick and simple.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/theyakka/cumulus.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/theyakka/cumulus)
[![Dart Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/Dart-2.0+-lightgrey.svg)](https://dartlang.org/)

# Features


# Installing

**Cumulus will probably require Dart 2.0+.** Cumulus was developed on the 2.0 (pre-release) version of Dart but, for now, it probably works fine on 1.X as well.

To install, add the following line to the `dependencies` section of your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  ...
  cumulus: ^1.0.0

```

You can then import cumulus using:

```dart
import 'package:cumulus/cumulus.dart';
```

# Getting started

TBD


# FAQ

## Why should I use this and not ____?

We prefer you use whatever you want. Cumulus is, most likely, no better or worse than the alternatives.

Cumulus was designed and developed because of an actual need to make working with Firebase Functions easier and faster. Developing apps should be fun, not tedious boilerplate and confusing templates. Hopefully Cumulus works for you personally.

Give it a try and if you like it, let us know! Either way, we love feedback.

## Has it been tested in production? Can I use it in production?

The code here is derived from the code that was written for Fluro (https://github.com/goposse/fluro). Fluro has been battle tested in the hamilton app in production and is used by millions of people. Cumulus is also in use serving Firebase Functions in other apps. That said, code is always evolving. We plan to keep on using it in production but we also plan to keep on improving it. If you find a bug, let us know!
